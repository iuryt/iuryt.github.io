## About me

I'm a **Computational Oceanographer**, currently working as a Postdoctoral Investigator at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://https://www.whoi.edu/) focused on the use of high-performance computational tools and methods in Big Data scientific issues in Marine Sciences.

Originally from Fortaleza (Brazil), I have a degree in Oceanography from the [Federal University of Ceará](https://https://www.ufc.br/) (2014), a Master's in Physical Oceanography from the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br) (2017) and a PhD in Computational Science and Engineering from the [University of Massachusetts Dartmouth](https://www.umassd.edu/) (2023). 

In the free time, I love playing accordion, dancing [Forró](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), studying history and hiking.
I am also [hemophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia) and I'm passionate about promoting understanding and raising awareness around rare genetic disorders.
