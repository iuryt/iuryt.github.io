Hi!

I am **Iury Simoes-Sousa** ([pt-br](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese): Iury Tércio Simões de Sousa). My first name is pronounced as the Russian yuri (YOO-ree). 

I am a **computational oceanographer** whose research focuses on using high-performance computational methods for addressing interdisciplinary questions in marine sciences.
More recently, I've been studying the interactions between ocean physics of different scales and their impacts on biogeochemical and atmospheric processes.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Investigator at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

In the free time, I love playing accordion, dancing [Forró](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forr%C3%B3), studying history and hiking.
I am also [hemophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia) and I'm passionate about promoting understanding and raising awareness around rare genetic disorders. 
By sharing my personal experience, I hope to inspire others to embrace their unique identities, build resilience, and advocate for positive societal changes.
