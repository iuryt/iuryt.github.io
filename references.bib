abstract = {{Satellite altimetry has revolutionized our understanding of ocean physics by providing global sea-surface height data. These measurements reveal the intricate dynamics of ocean mesoscale strain and vortices, and their interactions with multiple physical scales in the oceans. Although surface dynamics has been extensively studied, investigating the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies globally remains a computational challenge. In this study, we combine the comprehensive World Ocean Database (WOD) with a database of Eulerian mesoscale eddies (META3.2 DT). We pre-process and filter the WOD data, selecting quality controlled profiles at local depths greater than 100-m. By integrating WOD data with altimetry-derived mesoscale eddies, we aim to facilitate future studies on the role of mesoscale vortices in multiple processes, such as heat, mass and nutrient transport, and water-mass subduction. The analysis is performed using high-performance computing resources, with Python packages for parallel processing of the data and analysis of more than 4.2 million profiles with more than 35 million vortex observations. The dataset is available by download and by direct access through an OPeNDAP/HTTP server. Additionally, we provide the code for performing the vortex-profile matching, along with an example of use to facilitate future updates to the code and merged data. This dataset supports further research on eddy vertical structure, biogeochemical processes, and their role in climate systems across different regions and time periods.}},

  abstract = {Abstract In May 2024, southern Brazil experienced a severe flood that caused widespread devastation, particularly in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre. This disaster resulted from a rare combination of atmospheric conditions: a heatwave stalled a cold front, leading to prolonged and intense rainfall. The flood claimed 183 lives, left 27 missing, and displaced many more. Notably, the flood's peak coincided with satellite observations from both SWOT and Sentinel-2, providing a valuable snapshot of the disaster. To assess the flood's scope, and volume, we integrate these satellite data with FABDEM topography. SWOT's water height measurements, evaluated with in situ data, underscore its flood monitoring potential. The estimated floodwater volume was ∼ \${\sim} \$ 1.5 billion m3 \${\mathrm{m}}^{3}\$. While primarily damaging croplands, the flood directly affected ∼ \${\sim} \$ 420,000 individuals in the study region, with ∼ \${\sim} \$ 16\% identified as socially vulnerable. These findings offer insights into floodwater distribution and contribute to future flood dynamics research, mitigation strategies, and disaster preparedness.},

  abstract = {{In Northeastern Brazil, successful release programmes have been implemented for the conservation of West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus) since the 1990s. Recently, the non-government organization AQUASIS started releasing manatees in the state of Ceará, where oceanographic conditions and the absence of sheltered places pose new challenges for the release and monitoring of manatees. This research investigates the movement of a manatee named Tico, released in Icapuí, Ceará, Brazil, that travelled approximately 4017 km over 62 days through deep oceanic waters. Correlating Tico's trajectory and velocity with surface currents revealed the influence of the North Brazil Current (NBC) and its vortices on his movement. Tico crossed the diluted Amazon River plume with surface salinity as low as 26 g kg−1 in early August, potentially encountering areas of even lower salinity. Additionally, Tico experienced several storms, with significant rainfall during his journey, which may have provided freshwater. The erratic movement patterns and significant weight loss prompted the rescue of Tico on Isla la Blanquilla, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Tico is currently being temporarily housed in Parque Zoológico y Botánico Bararida in Venezuela. Understanding the nature of Tico's long-distance movement could help inform decisions about his future. AQUASIS proposes to return Tico to Brazil, a region with an ecologically and genetically distinct population from Venezuela, for a second release attempt, incorporating lessons learned from the first release. Furthermore, AQUASIS has the necessary human and financial resources to ensure the continuous monitoring of Tico during his readaptation to the wild.}},

abstract = {The Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) is a NASA Earth Ventures Suborbital investigation designed to test the hypothesis that oceanic frontogenesis and the kilometer-scale (“submesoscale”) instabilities that accompany it make important contributions to vertical exchange of climate and biological variables in the upper ocean. These processes have been difficult to resolve in observations, making model validation challenging. A necessary step toward testing the hypothesis was to make accurate measurements of upper-ocean velocity fields over a broad range of scales and to relate them to the observed variability of vertical transport and surface forcing. A further goal was to examine the relationship between surface velocity, temperature and chlorophyll measured by remote sensing, and their depth-dependent distributions, within and beneath the surface boundary layer. To achieve these goals, we used aircraft-based remote sensing, satellite remote sensing, ships, drifter deployments, and a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The observational component of S-MODE consisted of three campaigns, all conducted in the Pacific Ocean approximately 100 km west of San Francisco during 2021-2023 fall and spring. S-MODE was enabled by recent developments in remote sensing technology that allowed operational airborne observation of ocean surface velocity fields and by advances in autonomous instrumentation that allowed coordinated sampling with dozens of uncrewed vehicles at sea. The coordinated use of remote sensing measurements from three aircraft with arrays of remotely operated vehicles and other in situ measurements is a major novelty of S-MODE. All S-MODE data is freely available, and its use is encouraged.}

abstract = {The most conspicuous oceanographic features off Southeastern Brazil are the quasi-stationary eddies formed off Capes São Tomé (CSTE) and Frio (CFE) associated with the Brazil Current (BC). We use SST and SSH products to infer eddy growth rates. These two independent data sets reveal an average growth rate of 0.06day-1, and propagation speeds are virtually null. CFE tends to be more unstable and frequent than CSTE (3.5 vs. 2.3 events per year). CSTE can propagate toward the north or south while CFE only propagates southward. We perform potential vorticity (PV) inversion calculation using hydrographic data to understand how the meander growth occurs in the baroclinic jet formed by the BC and the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC). PV anomalies in one layer enhanced the anomalies on the other. This result offered in situ evidence of baroclinic conversion occurring during the eddy event captured in the observations. We then build a theoretical two-layer model calibrated with the observations seeking to explain why the eddies grow in place, and no accompanying unstable anticyclones are formed. The experiments lead us to conclude that the eddies’ quasi-stationarity is due to the almost pure baroclinic nature of the BC-IWBC jet. We also find that the western boundary inhibits the formation of the anticyclones. As observed in satellite imagery, the meanders develop as isolated disturbances that may grow simultaneously or not.}

In this study, we characterize the variability of mesoscale eddies associated with this western boundary current from its origin site to the southern end of the South Brazil Bight (∼15°S – ∼28°S). We apply an eddy detection method on a 27-year multi-satellite altimetry product. We offer a first quantitative estimate of the eddy dominance along the BC path. On average, there are no major differences in the eddy parameters between cyclones and anticyclones. However, north of the 20∘S, the eddies are larger and slower in swirling speed, whereas the opposite patterns occur with the eddies south of 20∘S. Although there is no notable seasonality in the eddy formation in general, there is a tendency to form cyclones in the vicinity of capes and bights of the southeastern Brazilian shelfbreak. In contrast, there is a scattered horizontal distribution of anticyclone formation for most of the BC domain throughout the seasons. The Vitória, Cape São Tomé and Cape Frio Eddies account for ∼30% of the total cyclones in the analysis. The Vitória Eddy (VE) tends to be more often generated in austral autumn, the season of lowest kinetic energy and volume transport of the BC. The Cape São Tomé Eddy (CSTE) and Cape Frio Eddy (CFE) are more energetic in the seasons of the BC’s highest volume transport (austral spring and summer). Despite most of the eddies being described as quasi-stationary in the current literature, our analysis of the eddy trajectories showed that the VE, CFE and CSTE can detach and migrate off of the mean BC axis. We estimate that ∼30% of the CFE events pinch off and migrate southwestward. The CSTE and CFE presented the highest growth rates (0.08 and 0.07 day−1 , respectively) of the recurrent eddies. These results provide a first robust characterization of the BC mesoscale eddies.}

abstract="Mixed layer eddies resulting from baroclinic instability of fronts convert horizontal buoyancy gradients into vertical stratification, shoaling the mixed layer. In light-limited regimes – high-latitudes – this process can initiate phytoplankton blooms prior to the springtime warming. The question is whether mixed layer eddies can enhance the spring bloom by delivering nutrients from beneath the mixed layer. We couple a submesoscale-resolving model (SUB) with a simple ecosystem model and examine the role of mixed layer eddies on the development of the spring bloom. We compare the SUB simulation to two coarser resolution (10 km) simulations, one that includes a mixed layer eddy parameterization (MLE) and another that prescribes the restratification from SUB and advects the biogeochemical tracers using geostrophic velocities (NVF). The MLE simulates restratification of the mixed layer and bloom onset, but the spring bloom has a deficit of 10–13% in the new production compared to SUB. The NVF has the same restratification as SUB, and with no vertical flux of nutrients, leads to a spring bloom with a 32–40% new production deficit compared to SUB. Submesoscale processes lead to exchange across the mixed layer base, which is not represented in coarse resolution model simulations, even with mixed layer eddy parameterizations. Our results show that nutrients supplied by mixed layer eddies are important to enhance the spring bloom.",

  abstract="Atmospheric cold pools, generated by evaporative downdrafts from precipitating clouds, are ubiquitous in the Bay of Bengal. We use data from three moorings near 18°N to characterize a total of 465 cold pools. The cold pools are all dry, with a typical temperature drop of 2°C (max. 5°C) and specific humidity drop of 1 g/kg (max. 6 g/kg). Most cold pools last 1.5-3.5 hours (max. 14 hours). Cold pools occur almost every day in the North Bay from April to November, principally in the late morning, associated with intense precipitation that accounts for 80% of total rain. They increase the latent heat flux to the atmosphere by about 32 W/m2(median), although the instantaneous enhancement of latent heat flux for individual cold pools reaches 150 W/m2 . During the rainiest month (July), the cold pools occur 21% of the time and contribute nearly 14% to the mean evaporation. A composite analysis of all cold pools shows that the temperature and specific humidity anomalies are responsible for ~90% of the enhancement of sensible and latent heat flux, while variations in wind speed are responsible for the remainder. Depending on their gust front speed, the estimated height of the cold pools primarily ranges from 850 to 3200 m, with taller fronts more likely to occur during the summer monsoon season (Jun-Sep). Our results indicate that the realistic representation of cold pools in climate models is likely to be important for improved simulation of air-sea fluxes and monsoon rainfall."

  abstract="Recent studies suggest that the South Brazil Bight (SBB) hosts strong westward propagating mesoscale eddies. We use 28 years of satellite altimetry data and a new Eddy Atlas to estimate how much of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) observed in the SBB is accounted for by local eddies, generated in the Brazil Current (BC) region, versus remote eddies generated eastward of the BC region. First, we estimate a BC frontal density to obtain a robust definition of BC region. The BC front is well-defined throughout the SBB, occupying the region between the 200-m and 1000-m isobath, except in eddy hotspots downstream of sharp inflections of the continental slope, where the EKE far exceeds the mean kinetic energy (MKE). Compact, closed-contour mesoscale eddies account for 30–50% of the total EKE observed in the SBB, with local eddies accounting for most of the compact EKE in the BC region, defined as the area within 200 km of the 28-year mean BC front. Remote compact eddies account for less than 10% of the EKE observed in the BC region; compact eddies generated at long distances from the SBB, including eddies generated in the Southeastern Atlantic, contribute an insignificant fraction of EKE in the BC region.",

These double-stacked anticyclones with incredibly high Rossby Number [O(10)] occur independently at different depths (high Burger number). Anticyclones with Rossby number greater than unity are unstable according to inviscid linear theory, and hence these submesoscale features are not easily observable at mid latitudes. At these low latitudes, they last about a week, allowing characterization by oceanographic surveys. Our analyses suggest this increased stability is due to the joint effect of strong winds, stratification, proximity to the equator, and topography. Heretofore hypothesized via analytical studies and seen in numerical models, our study confirms this stabilization process in observations, and is also a starting point for the description of the submesoscale dynamics in the NBC domain.",

  abstract="South of the Vitória-Trindade Ridge, a seamount chain off East Brazil, the Brazil Current (BC) meanders cyclonically within Tubarão Bight, occasionally forming the Vitória Eddy. It was recently found that the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC), which flows equatorward below the BC, cyclonically recirculate within Tubarão Bight. We present an analysis of AVISO observations that suggest that the Vitória Eddy formation is conditioned by the strength of the BC upstream of Tubarão Bight. A weak BC is prone to local meandering and eddy formation in the bight, while a strong BC suppresses eddy formation in the bight but triggers downstream meander growth. To study the effects of the IWBC recirculation on the BC meandering and the Vitória Eddy formation, we formulate a simple two-layer quasi-geostrophic model. In the model, the BC is represented by a meridional jet in the upper layer and the IWBC recirculation is a steady eddy in the lower layer. The lower-layer eddy effectively acts as a topographic bump, affecting the upper-layer jet via the stretching term \(\psi _{2}/{R_{d}^{2}}\), where ψ2 is the lower-layer streamfunction and Rd is the baroclinic deformation radius. Based on the AVISO sea-surface height data and previous observational studies, we define a stationary eddy and reference jet. We conduct a number of initial-value problem experiments varying the upper-layer jet speed. A weak upper-layer jet slowly meanders and develops a cyclone above the lower-layer eddy. As we increase the jet velocity, the meandering is faster and the cyclone is larger. But a too-strong jet has an opposite effect: the potential vorticity anomalies induced by the lower-layer eddy are quickly swept away, leading to explosive downstream meander growth; no cyclone is formed above the lower-layer eddy. In all cases, the initial meandering trigger is a linear process (the steering of the upper-layer jet by the lower-layer eddy). But even when the upper-layer jet is weak, nonlinearity quickly becomes important, dominating the dynamics after 10 days of simulation. The downstream meander growth is fully nonlinear. Our idealized QG model confirms that the IWBC recirculation can trigger the Vitória Eddy formation and elucidates the mechanisms involved in this process.",

Here, we summarize the 2018 monsoon onset using observations collected through the multinational Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BoB) program between the US, India, and Sri Lanka. MISO-BoB aims to improve understanding of monsoon intraseasonal variability, and the 2018 field effort captured the coupled air-sea response during a transition from active-to-break conditions in the central BoB. The active phase of the ~20-day research cruise was characterized by warm sea surface temperature (SST > 30°C), cold atmospheric outflows with intermittent heavy rainfall, and increasing winds (from 2 to 15 m s−1). Accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm with 90\% of precipitation occurring during the first week. The following break period was both dry and clear, with persistent 10−12 m s−1 wind and evaporation of 0.2 mm h−1. The evolving environmental state included a deepening ocean mixed layer (from ~20 to 50 m), cooling SST (by ~ 1°C), and warming/drying of the lower to mid-troposphere. Local atmospheric development was consistent with phasing of the large-scale intraseasonal oscillation. The upper ocean stores significant heat in the BoB, enough to maintain SST above 29°C despite cooling by surface fluxes and ocean mixing. Comparison with reanalysis indicates biases in air-sea fluxes, which may be related to overly cool prescribed SST. Resolution of such biases offers a path toward improved forecasting of transition periods in the monsoon.",

  abstract="The southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (SSEC) is the northern limit of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. When this current reaches Brazil around 14°S it bifurcates into a southward flow as the Brazil Current (BC) and the surface portion of the northward flowing North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). The SSEC system is a key component of the western boundary supply, influencing the NBUC/BC variability and, therefore, global climate through the Meridional Overturning Circulation. In this study, using altimetry satellite data and reanalyzes outputs (1993–2018), we revisit the SSEC mean state and show this current arriving at the South Atlantic western boundary as a multi-banded flow with surface signatures resulting from different subsurface cores. These bands have velocities between 0.02 and 0.07 m s$^{−1}$ and, as shown by ADCP data from the PIRATA project, their signature in synoptic scenarios is obscured by eddies and waves with velocities between 0.1 and 0.3 m s$^{−1}$. In addition, the SSEC annual cycle analysis shows that the seasonality of the bands is out of phase with each other, presenting westward transport anomalies between 0.4 and 2.6 Sv. Finally, our results show that the seasonality of this multi-banded flow both defines where the BC is born, and modulates the seasonality of semi-permanent mesoscale eddies off Brazil.",

We were able to reproduce the wind-forced anticyclonic and asymmetric gyre, including the western boundary intensification and its retroflection. The latter phenomenon was predicted by the non-linear version of Munk's model and observed in real subtropical gyres as small recirculation regions. We have configured two numerical model simulations mimicking the physical experiment, with linear and non-linear terms. The comparison between the numerical and physical experiments confirmed the effect of non-linear distortion of the gyre. Geophysical fluid dynamics is often hard to visualize, and counter-intuitive in a rotating system. We present this set of experiments as a tool for oceanography teaching.
