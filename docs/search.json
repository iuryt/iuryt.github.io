    "text": "Hi!\nMy name is Iury T. Simoes-Sousa (pt-br: Iury Tércio Simões de Sousa). My name is pronounced as the Russian yuri (YOO-ree). I am an oceanographer and computational scientist.\nI was born in Fortaleza in Northeast Brazil, but I currently live in New Bedford. I am a last-year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where I apply different data analysis methods and modeling to investigate ocean and atmosphere dynamics. Check my full list of published papers on the link at the top.\nMy main scientific interests are air-sea coupling and interaction, biophysical processes, and the transfer of energy between motions on different spatial and temporal scales.\nIn the free time, I love playing accordion, dancing Forró, studying history and hiking. I am also hemophilic and I’m passionate about promoting understanding and raising awareness around rare genetic disorders. By sharing my personal experience, I hope to inspire others to embrace their unique identities, build resilience, and advocate for positive change."

    "text": "Why integrate Obsidian with GitHub?\nRecently I started using Obsidian to organize my notes. What I love most about this software is that everything is in Markdown, which not only makes it easy to access and port to other tools, but I am also free to make my own code in Python or other languages to interact with the notes. If you are curious about Obsidian, there are several tutorials on the internet for you to learn how to use it.\nObsidian is a great note-taking app that uses Markdown, making it easy to access and port your notes to other tools. However, Obsidian charges a fee for synchronization between different devices. One way to work around this is to use a storage service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. However, if you want to mix code and tutorials with your notes or are concerned about different versions of your notes, integrating with GitHub is a good alternative. GitHub allows you to store your notes on its platform and also provides version control, which means you can keep track of all changes made to your notes."
