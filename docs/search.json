    "title": "Integrating Google Colab and GitHub",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently I have been studying on how to setup GitHub with Google Colab to keep track of the changes while storing code on the cloud. This is mainly because I am remotely advising an undergrad student that doesn’t have access to computer resources and I am planning to use Google Colab as a workspace while doing the version control using git. To follow this tutorial, I am assuming you have a Google and a GitHub account.\n\nCreating a repository\nThe first thing you need is to have a repository for the project. On https://github.com/new you can go ahead and setup a new repository. In this example it will be a public repository, but the same works for private ones.\n\nFor this example, I am adding a README.md file, a .gitignore based on a Python template under MIT License. Once you created the repository, we now need to make sure we can access it by Google Colab environment.\n\n\nSetting up a fine-grained access token on GitHub\nNow we need a token. Private access tokens are special passwords that you can configure to have different permissions to your account on GitHub. On GitHub website, click on settings on the menu bar that shows up after clicking your profile photo.\n Now scroll down the left side bar and click on Developer settings and then click on Fine-grained tokens under Personal access tokens.\n\nThis will open a new tab and you will be able to see a button for creating a new token. For this example, I am setting up this token for 30 days and selecting this repository only. (For repositories under an organization, change the resource owner to the organization where the repository is stored.)\n\nFor Repository permissions, change the access to the Contents to Read and Write.\n\nNow scroll down and click in Generate token. This will show you the list of tokens and you will be able to copy this one.\n\nNow we can go to Google Drive to setup our workspace and git commands.\n\n\nSetting up Google Drive and Colab\nOn Google Drive, setup a folder for your repositories. In my case, I created a folder called Shared. Now create a new Google Colab file in this folder. This colab file will run the git commands. In my case, I am calling it Git.ipynb.\nThe fist cell of this notebook will mount your Google Drive\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\nThe next cell will clone the repository and configure the global variables for git.\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Repository name\nrepository = \"ColabTesting\"\n\n# Base path\nbase = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Shared\"\n\n# Specify the folder path\nfolder_path = f\"{base}/{repository}\"  # Change this to the desired folder path\n\n# Username\nusername = \"<your-username>\"\n\n# User email\nemail = \"<your-email>\"\n\n# Full name\nname = \"<your-full-name>\"\n\n# Token\ntoken = \"<token>\"\n\n# Owner\nowner = username\n\n# Move to the repository folder\n%cd {base}\n\n# Check if folder exists\nif not os.path.exists(folder_path):\n    clone_url = f'https://{username}:{token}@github.com/{owner}/{repository}.git'\n    # Clone repository from GitHub\n    !git clone {clone_url}\nelse:\n    print(f\"Folder '{folder_path}' already exists.\")\n\n# Move to folder\n%cd {folder_path}\n\n!git pull\n\n# Update .gitconfig using subprocess\nsubprocess.run(['git', 'config', '--global', 'user.email', email], check=True)\nsubprocess.run(['git', 'config', '--global', 'user.name', name], check=True)\nThe following cells are for git commands.\nPulling changes from remote:\n!git pull\nChecking the status:\n!git status\nStaging all local changes:\n!git add --all\nComment on the changes:\n!git commit -m \"Update\"\nPush it back to remote:\n!git push\n\n\nTesting the workflow\nNow you have a new folder on the google drive. Let try to create a notebook there and test the git workflow.\n\nNow we can come back to Git.ipynb and run the whole notebook. It will bypass the clone command, pull changes from remote, stage this change, comment and push it back to remote.\nIn my case, the first !git status returned:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nUntracked files:\n    (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n    Test_Notebook.ipynb\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n!git commit -m \"Update\" retuned:\n[main 52968bb] Update\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\ncreate mode 100644 Test_Notebook.ipynb\nThe second !git status returned:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n    (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nAnd the !git push returned:\nEnumerating objects: 4, done. \nCounting objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nDelta compression using up to 2 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 501 bytes | 125.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.\nTo [https://github.com/iuryt/ColabTesting.git](https://github.com/iuryt/ColabTesting.git) \n    dfaaaea..52968bb main -> main\nNow, everytime you make a change in the repository, you come back to this file and run the git commands.\nPlease, let me know in the comments below if this tutorial helped you, that means a lot to me and helps me keeping motivated while posting here."

    "text": "Why integrate Obsidian with GitHub?\nRecently I started using Obsidian to organize my notes. What I love most about this software is that everything is in Markdown, which not only makes it easy to access and port to other tools, but I am also free to make my own code in Python or other languages to interact with the notes. If you are curious about Obsidian, there are several tutorials on the internet for you to learn how to use it.\nObsidian is a great note-taking app that uses Markdown, making it easy to access and port your notes to other tools. However, Obsidian charges a fee for synchronization between different devices. One way to work around this is to use a storage service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. However, if you want to mix code and tutorials with your notes or are concerned about different versions of your notes, integrating with GitHub is a good alternative. GitHub allows you to store your notes on its platform and also provides version control, which means you can keep track of all changes made to your notes."

    "title": "Cookbook for nice scientific presentations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is a work in progress and will be updated every time I remember something new or have new good tips to add. The idea is to make a cookbook with examples and counter-examples for preparing good scientific presentations, but for now I will simply list what I personally consider good practices for preparing a good presentation. This is a compilation of my own opinions, tips that I have received from various people and sources that I have not yet organized in a systematic way, i.e. it is not restricted to my own ideas, but ideas that I have also collected throughout my still short academic career.\n\nOn the first slide you must make clear the topic of the presentation, authors, funding agencies, and affiliated institutions. The funding agencies can also be on the acknowledgements slide. You can also add a summary image that gives a graphic idea of the object of study, but it is not essential.\nPrefer a white background, but you can use color design for sidebars, top or bottom.\nAlways number your slides. This is extremely important to help people elaborate and reference the questions at the end of the presentation.\nUse a color code for different context. For example, standard text can be in black with some bold. Important things in red and quotes in green. This can help people identify the main points without having to read the whole text.\nAfter the title slide you can have a short slide to introduce yourself. This is especially important for early-career scientists. You can list your projects, collaborations, scientific interests, and even comment on some hobbies that you have. This is a good opportunity to connect with the audience, so you can mention something that connects you to the place you are presenting or to people in the audience.\nAfter that you can have an outline slide, which gives a general idea of the path you will take with the audience. While not mandatory, it can help the audience understand the order and logic of the presentation, but don’t go into too much detail. It is just to give an idea.\nI like to start the presentation itself with a slide that has minimal text and an image that takes up much of the space. This image should impact the audience and give a visual sense of the object of study. For example, I often start the presentation of my work on phytoplankton blooms with an image of trees in springtime bloom in the continent. Right after I present a satellite image of phytoplankton blooms in the open ocean. This usually has an impact and makes it clear up front that the main topic of the paper is spring blooms and that, despite the differences, they also occur in the ocean.\nDo your best to explicitly present the scientific questions. The central goal of the introduction is to try as much as possible to make the audience almost predict these questions, i.e. to make clear what has not yet been investigated and its importance.\nFor content slides, I generally start building the slide with an image and add text only for what the image does not say by itself, or for things that I want to emphasize in the image. This prevents the slides from having too much text.\nPlease explicitly explain what is being presented in the figures, their axes, colors, units, etc..\nTowards the end of each section, you can remind the audience what we learned from those analyses. Not everything will seem obvious to those watching, so it’s important to make that explicit.\nPrepare a good question or statement for the last slide. Avoid ending with an explicit thank you. The idea is to make the audience want to learn more about the subject, so try to stimulate their curiosity with a last message.\n\nI wrote this post in just a few minutes and with all certainty I know I am leaving out most of the complexity surrounding this topic. Over time I plan to populate and update this post with new ideas, but if you have any other ideas that you don’t see covered here, you can also post them in the comments here below."

Additionally, I investigate the interaction between physical processes, such as how vortices can group internal waves that break and generate mixing in the interior ocean. I use cutting-edge computational tools to analyze and visualize observational and model data, as well as to develop new methods and tools for data analysis and visualization.\nI am also passionate about educational and diversity projects. As a scientist, I believe in making my research accessible to a broader audience and promoting diversity in STEM. To this end, I am committed to developing outstanding courses that find creative ways to teach computational oceanography in underprivileged universities and communities. I believe everyone should have the opportunity to learn about the exciting world of oceanography and its vital role in understanding our planet.\nThrough my research and educational efforts, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of our planet’s complex systems and to inspire the next generation of scientists and leaders. In addition, I am committed to collaborating with fellow researchers and sharing my knowledge and expertise with students and the wider community.\n\nPublications"
